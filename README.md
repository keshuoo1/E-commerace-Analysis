# 📊 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

End-to-End Data Analytics Project | SQL • Python • Power BI

# 🚀 Why This Project Stands Out

This project simulates a real-world retail analytics problem where leadership needs actionable insights, not just dashboards.

I worked as a Data Analyst to clean messy data, answer critical business questions, and deliver executive-ready insights that can directly influence revenue growth, customer retention, and marketing strategy.

# 🧠 Business Objective

A retail company is experiencing
unclear customer spending behavior,inefficient discount strategies,low subscription conversion,no clear customer segmentation.

# How can customer transaction data be used to improve revenue, retention, and decision-making?

# 📂 Dataset Overview

Transactions: 3,900 purchases

Columns: 18

Data Includes:

Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Location)

Purchase behavior (Category, Amount, Season, Discounts)

Engagement metrics (Review Rating, Subscription Status)

Real-World Issue: Missing & inconsistent ratings data (handled professionally)

# 🛠 Tech Stack (Industry-Relevant)
Tool	Usage
Python (Pandas, NumPy)	Data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering
SQL (PostgreSQL)	Business analysis & insights
Power BI	Executive dashboards & storytelling
GitHub	Version control & documentation
# 🔄 Analytics Lifecycle 
# 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)

Fixed missing review ratings using category-level median

Standardized column naming (snake_case)

Removed redundant fields after validation

Created business-ready features:

age_group

purchase_frequency_days

# ✔ Shows strong data quality & judgment skills

# 2️⃣ SQL Business Analysis (Decision-Driven Queries)

Answered real executive questions, including:

Revenue contribution by gender

High-spending customers despite discounts

Top-rated products by customer reviews

Standard vs Express shipping behavior

Subscribers vs Non-Subscribers revenue

Discount-dependent products (margin risk)

Customer segmentation:

New

Returning

Loyal

Revenue by age group

Subscription likelihood of repeat buyers

# ✔ Demonstrates SQL + business thinking, not just syntax

# 3️⃣ Power BI Dashboard (Executive View)

Designed an interactive business dashboard with:

KPI cards (Customers, Avg Spend, Ratings)

Revenue & sales by category

Subscription penetration

Age-wise performance

Dynamic slicers for stakeholder analysis

# ✔ Recruiter takeaway: Can present insights to leadership

# 📈 Key Business Insights

Male customers generated significantly higher revenue

Express shipping users showed higher average order value

Several products are highly discount-dependent, impacting margins

Young Adult & Middle-Aged customers drive most revenue

Majority customers fall into the Loyal segment

Subscription customers show strong retention but need better conversion strategies

# 💡 Strategic Recommendations

🎯 Push subscription benefits to loyal non-subscribers

💰 Optimize discounts for margin-sensitive products

📦 Promote express shipping for higher AOV

⭐ Highlight top-rated products in marketing campaigns

👥 Personalize campaigns for high-value age groups

✔ Shows business impact, not just analysis
